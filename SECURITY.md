# Security Policy

If you found a security vulnerability in Schedule, you can report it. Read below what versions of Schedule are being supported for security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report security vulnerabilities in the `#schedule` channel of the freenode IRC server (where I'm present 24/7, so any message sent there will be seen by me), or you can directly mail me to [msfninja@airmail.cc](mailto:msfninja@airmail.cc).

If the vulnerability is of low, medium or high importance, I will get to it as soon as i scheduled my next Schedule coding. If the vulnerability is of critical importance, I will get my hands on it as soon as I can.

As soon as the security fix gets implemented, it will get pushed. The security fix notice will be added in the `CHANGELOG` file under the specific version of the very next release after the security fix implementation, or under `Unreleased` before the release.
